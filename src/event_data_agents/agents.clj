; An Agent should present its manifest as a hashmap with the following keys:
; :agent-name - The name of the Agent, for identification purposes.
; :source-id - The source ID for Events. Used to identify where the data came from, also for JWT auth.
; :license - A license URL.
; :source-token - The registered source token that identifies this Agent.
; :schedule - Seq of tuples of [function seconds-delay-between-runs]
; :runners - Seq of functions that should be run and kept running.
